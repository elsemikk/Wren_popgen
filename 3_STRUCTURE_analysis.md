All files produced by STRUCTURE, as well as the formatted input data, are found in the folder 3_STRUCTURE_data. The `.spj` files can be openned as a project by STRUCTURE, and the subfolder `corad_100k100k/results` contain the results of the 50 STRUCTURE runs.

The results of STRUCTURE Harvester are also placed in the folder `3_STRUCTURE_data`, in a zipped directory called `STRUCTURE_Harvester_corad100k100k.gz`. These results were used to conclude that k=2 was the most appropriate fit to the data.

Since each value of k was run with 10 iterations, we combinated all ten results of k=2 using CLUMPP. The input and output files of this are placed in `3_STRUCTURE_data/CLUMPP`.
